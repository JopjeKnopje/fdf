### LinkedList version
* Have a `point` datatype (vec3d with pixel color).
* gnl the map file
* split on each space and add each `point` to the linked list

#### Pro's and cons
Dynamic | slow


### 2DArray version `z = points[x][y]`
* Have a 2D int array contianing a `point` with this time containing only the z coord and the colorvalue.
* gnl the map file





## TODO
